load('spamTrain.mat');
fid = fopen('spamTrain.txt','w+');
for ex_idx=1:size(X,1)
    for feature_idx=1:size(X,2)
        fprintf(fid,'%.15f,',X(ex_idx,feature_idx));
    end
    fprintf(fid,'%d',y(ex_idx));
    fprintf(fid, '\n');
end
fclose(fid);

Note that spamTest.txt is a 33 MB file, so it has not been included in this repository.

for ex_idx=1:size(Xtest,1)
    for feature_idx=1:size(Xtest,2)
        fprintf(fid,'%.15f,',Xtest(ex_idx,feature_idx));
    end
    fprintf(fid,'%d',ytest(ex_idx));
